<h1>Careers In Web And Digital Development</h1>
	<h3>By. Chris Stump, january 14th, 2020</h3>
	
<p>The growth of the web over the last couple of decades has brought with it some new job titles. For example, had anyone ever heard of a webmaster prior to the mid-1990s? It has also redefined some older titles like advertising sales rep. Advertising sales reps used to sell ad space or time only in magazines and newspapers and on radio and television. Over the last two decades, they've added Websites to their repertoire.</p>

The Web and Digital Design Pathway here at Paulding County High School will equip students with the ability to plan, design, and create  websites.

These elements include text, graphics, animation, sound, video and digital imaging, photography, in addition to computer programming, visual development, project development and web processes.  Skills learned will help students create and design websites that incorporate digital media elements used to enhance content of a website. Students in this pathway will learn to work individually and in teams to create web professional looking web sites.  Professional communication skills and practices, problem-solving, ethical and legal issues, and the impact of effective presentation skills will be enhanced in this pathway to prepare students to be college and career ready.   </p>

	<p>Web developers need a combination of graphic design skills and technical computer skills that will allow them to create particular designs on web pages. In addition to looking nice, websites need to be functional and secure. It is the responsibility of web developers to create such sites that meet the requirements of employers or clients. Web developers often are implementing ideas that others may have even those others lack the technical know-how to turn those ideas into an actual, functional website. Web developers build and shape visitors’ experiences at websites. They do this through the creation of page layouts (headings and paragraphs), website styling (colors and fonts), and page features (animations and pictures). Interactive features, such as submitting online payments securely, are a necessary feature of e-commerce sites. In some settings, web developers can get started with no more than a high school diploma, but an associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree typically is needed to advance in the field. This job generally requires the ability to do the following work:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Graphic design</li>
	<li>Know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and other relevant web design coding languages</li>
	<li>Collaborate</li>
	<li>Present design specs</li>
	<li>Troubleshoot website problems</li>
	<li>Maintain and update websites</li>
	<li>Stay up-to-date on technology</li></ul>
	<p>While many employers prefer to hire job candidates with a bachelor's degree in a computer-related field, some will consider those with experience and certification only. Web developers earned a median annual salary of $77,010 in 2017 according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

	<img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/rFBQzTgEqigG4/200.webp?cid=790b7611cb08b6afb903da59ac61f8ef8e8ef899405a9bfc&rid=200.webp" alt="cinematographer" style="width:250px;">
	
	<p>A cinematographer is also known as a director of photography (DP), is the person in charge of the camera department which includes all camera operators, camera assistants, focus pullers, and lighting crews. The DP is responsible for capturing the photographic impression of the directors’ vision. While the director determines the action and blocking of a given scene, it is the DP who looks through the camera to catch the moment on film. The director gives his/her vision of a particular shot to the DP, who then translates that into how the camera will capture it.

The DP receives a shot list from the director and then analyzes how each scene will be lit, which camera filters and lenses to use, and the position of the camera. To be a truly memorable cinematographer, there are a few skills you will want to master:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Your eye: Before the camera captures a shot, you need to fully envision it in your own mind. This is a skill that needs to be developed very early.</li>
	<li>Lighting: Study lighting. In everyday life, look around and see how light works to set a mood. You have to understand how to work with lighting to get the most out of your shots.</li>
	<li>Study the past: Study movies and find out what it is about certain shots that work and learn how it was accomplished.</li>
	<li>Technology: Stay up on the latest photographic technology.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There are no specific educational requirements to work as a producer, but many employers require a bachelor's degree along with experience. Many people who want to be cinematographers will study film in college. A degree in business management can also be very useful.  Cinematographers earned a median annual salary of $71,620 in 2017. </p>

	<p>Computer and information systems (CIS) managers coordinate and direct computer-related activities for companies or organizations. They may go by one of several titles, each with different responsibilities. For example a chief information officer (CIO) oversees an entity's entire technology strategy. A chief technology officer (CTO) evaluates new technology to determine how it can benefit an organization. An information technology (IT) director manages an IT department. An IT security manager is responsible for network and data security.  This job generally requires the ability to do the following work:</p>
	<ul><li>Analyze computer needs</li>
	<li>Recommend possible upgrades</li>
	<li>Oversee installation and maintenance of hardware and software</li>

	<li>Stay up to date on new technologies</li>
	<li>Oversee training on new equipment or software</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Regardless of the area of focus, CIS managers are expected to have the expertise to identify and implement the best computer systems for a firm's needs. This includes hardware, software, storage needs, cloud computing, security, training, and budgeting. Business owners and other high-ranking executives rarely have the IT expertise to know what is best for their needs, so they rely on their CIS managers to implements the best systems possible based on needs and budget.</p>
	
	<p>Most employers expect IT professionals to have at least a bachelor's degree with computer science or information technology major. In addition to a degree, employers usually expect CIS managers to have several years of experience working in IT.
